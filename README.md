# computorv2

My 42 project computorv2 (C++)

## Objective
Partially recreate the bc program (and then some :))
The main point of doing this project was to challenge myself discovering newer C++ features (using C++ smart pointers, abstractions, rvalue)

### Special thanks
I wouldn't have been able to do the project without the precious help of Prof. Harry Porter's video on how to make a recursive decent parser; as well as my schoolmate @nils-mathieu and his much appreciated insights for helping me perfecting it.
